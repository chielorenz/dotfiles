# Dotfiles

Configuration files to automate the setup of my macos development environment.

The installation script is a "rolling" setup, which means you can run it multiple times without worrying to screw things
up, so if you want to change the setup you can update this repo and run the script again.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chielorenz/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && sh ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

## Uninstall

```bash
sh ~/.dotfiles/uninstall.sh
```
